# Simple login Todo Leptos Application

This is a sample test application for me to learn Leptos and Rust
The goal is to develop a very easy Stack base that can be deployed anywhere with Containers
1 Leptos
2 Axum
3 Postgres
4 Mabey some Auth service like supertokens?

The goal is to have it as simple as:
`docker compose up`

## Help, Suggestions and Contributions are Greatly Appreciated.

(When it is hopefully at some point in an actual usable state)
